# Secure Data Hiding in Images Using Steganography

This project implements a robust method for concealing and retrieving secret messages within images using image steganography. By subtly modifying pixel values, the hidden data remains undetectable, ensuring the original image quality is preserved. The integration of passcode protection adds an additional layer of security, restricting access to the concealed data to authorized users only.

## Features

- **Image Steganography**: Securely hide and retrieve messages within image files without noticeable changes to the image.
- **Passcode Protection**: Add a passcode to protect hidden messages, ensuring that only authorized users can access the data.
- **High Security**: Utilize efficient algorithms that ensure the hidden data is both secure and undetectable.
- **Preserved Image Quality**: The original image quality remains almost unchanged after the secret message is embedded.
- **Lightweight and Efficient**: The steganography method is optimized for minimal resource usage and high performance.
- **Wide Applications**: Ideal for cybersecurity, journalism, military intelligence, and personal privacy.

## Future Enhancements

- **AI-driven Concealment**: Future updates will explore the use of AI to enhance the concealment process, making the hidden data even more secure and difficult to detect.
- **Enhanced Encryption**: Implement stronger encryption algorithms to further protect the concealed messages, ensuring that unauthorized users cannot retrieve or decode the hidden data.
- **Multi-format Support**: Expand support for different image formats (PNG, JPEG, TIFF, etc.) and other multimedia files.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Libraries:
  - `cv2` for image processing.
  - `os` Used to interact with the operating system (opening the encrypted image).
  - `numpy` - Used to modify image pixels for hiding and extracting messages.
